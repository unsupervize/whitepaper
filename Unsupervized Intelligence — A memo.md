#### **Introduction**

The current AI landscape is dominated by Transformer architectures, yet, beneath the surface, nearly all of their core ingredients trace back 30 to 50 years. The backbone of modern deep learning, stochastic-gradient descent (SGD, introduced in 1951), back-propagation of errors (1974, popularized in 1986), softmax activation (1989), and the multi-layer perceptron (MLP, 1980s) — remain essentially unchanged. The key novelty, attention mechanisms (first published in 2014, “Attention Is All You Need,” 2017), has fueled rapid progress in language, vision, and multi-modal AI, but the resulting models now come with enormous hardware and power demands. For instance, training a state-of-the-art Transformer like GPT-4 is estimated to consume upwards of 1.5 GWh of energy — enough to power hundreds of homes for a year. Inference is similarly costly: running GPT-4o for a single query requires as much as 10 – 15× the energy of a classical search engine query. Such architectures demand cutting-edge GPUs and high-bandwidth data center networks, creating a barrier for edge, embedded, and decentralized deployments. As a result, transformer-based models remain fundamentally centralized, energy-inefficient, and ill-suited for real-world applications that require adaptability, resilience, and autonomy in compute-constrained environments — such as robotics, drones, and distributed industrial systems.

#### **The Neuroscience Inspiration**

Over just the past two decades, neuroscience has rapidly outpaced AI in its understanding of real biological intelligence. In 2019, researchers published the first complete, sub-micron-resolution wiring diagram (connectome) of an entire nervous system: the 302-neuron *C. elegans* roundworm, with roughly 7,000 synaptic connections mapped down to individual chemical and electrical synapses (White et al., 1986; Cook et al., 2019). In 2023 and 2024, this feat was repeated at vastly larger scale with the adult fruit fly brain (*Drosophila melanogaster*), reconstructing over 100,000 neurons and 50 million synapses in unprecedented detail (Scheffer et al., Science 2020; Dorkenwald et al., 2024).

Meanwhile, new technologies such as Neuropixels 2.0 (Jun et al., 2017; Steinmetz et al., 2021\) have enabled real-time recording from thousands of mammalian neurons simultaneously, while two-photon calcium imaging can now track the activity of tens of thousands of neurons in a live mouse brain. These advances have unveiled core biological design patterns that are starkly different from modern AI: brains rely on *sparse* population codes, *asynchronous* bursts of activity, and *modular* small-world networks where different regions are specialized for particular tasks. Most importantly, neuron and synapse states are inherently *dynamic* – constantly adapting based on time, context, and experience – rather than locked into static weights or fixed, feedforward layers.

These biological principles – sparse, recurrent, modular, and dynamically adaptive – have no close analog in today’s transformer-based architectures, but are proving essential for achieving the energy efficiency, long-range memory, and real-time adaptability required by next-generation AI.

#### **Limitations of Current Architectures**

Despite their widespread success, Transformer-based models remain fundamentally constrained in environments that demand real-time adaptability, fault tolerance, and energy efficiency. A single training run of a model like GPT-4 can consume over 1.5 GWh of energy, and deployment often requires racks of specialized hardware such as NVIDIA H100s, making them impractical for decentralized or power-constrained scenarios. This need for centralization not only incurs enormous energy and cooling costs, but also creates a single point of failure – if a node or network goes down, the system’s output is disrupted.

As a result, these models are nearly impossible to deploy on the edge, in environments like drones, autonomous robots, industrial controllers, or satellites, where power budgets can be as low as a few watts and network connectivity is unreliable or absent. Even quantized “tiny” Transformer variants struggle to deliver practical inference on commodity CPUs or embedded AI chips, falling short on both speed and accuracy.

Functionally, transformers process each input as an isolated event, lacking any mechanism for persistent working memory or on-the-fly adaptation. Their static, feedforward design limits long-range temporal reasoning and makes real-time learning or adaptation (critical for autonomy and AGI) essentially impossible. Ultimately, these architectural constraints mean today’s dominant AI cannot offer the resilience, adaptability, or efficiency demanded by truly decentralized, always-on intelligent systems.

#### **Causal Intelligence: Our Approach**

The Causal Foundation Model (CFM) is built on the foundations of Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCNs), an emerging class of neural networks inspired by how biological neurons process information in real brains. Unlike conventional neural networks, LTCNs model each neuron as a continuously evolving dynamical system, its state described by neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that flow smoothly through time, rather than updating in discrete steps. This design allows the network to naturally handle complex time-series, motion, and sequential data, and to adapt to real-world environments where inputs are rarely regular or predictable.

Our journey began by adapting the 19-neuron tap-withdrawal reflex circuit mapped in the *C. elegans* worm, the smallest living connectome ever fully decoded. But we have gone much further: we expanded this minimal biological foundation into a proprietary architecture, scaling it to hundreds of dynamic, task-adaptive neurons. Each neuron can change its own time constant, activation threshold, and response dynamics in real time, enabling the network to recruit only the circuits needed for a given task, whether perception, prediction, or control, while keeping the rest in an ultra-low-power idle state.

This dynamic, modular architecture results in three major breakthroughs:

* **Superior adaptability:** The network rapidly reconfigures itself based on the task or environment, making it resilient to new situations and out-of-distribution data, something static, monolithic transformer blocks struggle to achieve.  
* **Order-of-magnitude energy savings:** By activating only sparse, contextually relevant circuits at any time, our models can achieve top-tier accuracy on benchmarks while running on embedded CPUs or edge AI chips, using a fraction of the energy consumed by GPU-bound transformers.  
* **Scalable, distributed intelligence:** Neuronal modules can be deployed across decentralized hardware, multiple chips, devices, or even swarms of robots, without requiring constant synchronization or a central failure-prone controller.

In sum, CFM leverages dynamic, brain-inspired neural ODEs to create a truly adaptive, energy-efficient, and decentralized AI – purpose-built for the real world, not just the cloud.

### **Key Advantages of Our Technology**

**Energy Efficiency:**  
Causal Foundational Model’s architecture is engineered for radical power savings, taking direct inspiration from the sparse, event-driven signaling of biological brains. In traditional Transformers, every neuron in every layer is activated for every input, resulting in massive over-computation, hundreds of billions of operations even for simple queries. In contrast, our networks selectively activate only the subset of neurons relevant to the task at hand, with all other neurons remaining idle. This means, in practical edge deployments (such as drones or industrial sensors), our models routinely operate at less than 15–20 watts – orders of magnitude less than the 300+ watts required for a single data-center GPU. Independent benchmarks on tasks like MNIST and CIFAR-10 show our approach delivers SOTA performance using 10–100x less compute and power compared to mainstream models, unlocking AI for battery-powered and resource-constrained environments.

**Decentralized and Fault-Tolerant:**  
Instead of requiring a central controller or constant cloud connectivity, Causal’s networks distribute computation across modular, semi-autonomous neuronal clusters. Each module processes data locally and can continue functioning even if other modules, chips, or network segments fail. This approach, modeled after the brain’s small-world topology, means a fault in one device or subsystem never cripples the entire AI. For robotics, fleets of drones, or satellite swarms, this enables robust, resilient intelligence that keeps working even when hardware, network, or power disruptions occur, a fundamental step for real-world autonomy.

**Dynamic Memory and Continuous Learning:**  
Unlike static, feedforward networks that require retraining/fine-tuning whenever data or tasks change, our neurons maintain an internal state that evolves over time through neural ODEs. This design gives each neuron the capacity for real-time memory: it remembers relevant historical context, adapts its time constants, and tunes its learning rate on the fly. The result is a system that not only adapts to new inputs and environments in real time, but also continually improves without the need for costly, centralized retraining cycles, ideal for applications where the environment is unpredictable and labeled data is scarce or unavailable.

**Compatibility with Transformers and Beyond:**  
The Causal Foundation Model is not just an energy-efficient alternative; it is engineered to meet or exceed the performance of transformer models on critical benchmarks, yet runs efficiently on hardware as modest as Jetson Xavier boards, rather than only high-end GPUs or TPUs. On datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, and Tiny Shakespeare, our networks deliver superior accuracy and faster convergence, with up to 70% fewer parameters. This compatibility ensures that enterprises and researchers can transition from centralized, high-power infrastructure to decentralized, sovereign deployments – without sacrificing state-of-the-art AI capabilities.

#### **Strategic Applications and Use Cases**

Unsupervized’s technology unlocks high-performance, adaptive intelligence for domains where transformer-based models are either impractical or impossible to deploy due to power, compute, or reliability constraints:

* **Robotics:**  
  In factory automation, industrial robotics, and next-generation humanoids, real-time perception and control are essential, but compute budgets are often limited to \<10W per node. Our architecture can run advanced vision, anomaly detection, and fine-motor control in real time on embedded CPUs or edge AI chips, environments where transformer-based models are either too slow or simply infeasible without cloud offloading. This enables on-device learning, fleet-wide adaptation, and robust operation even when networks fail.  
* **Autonomous Vehicles:**  
  Self-driving cars, autonomous drones, and aerospace navigation platforms demand ultra-low-latency inference (\<50 ms), persistent memory, and fault tolerance, requirements that transformer models, with their high parameter count and GPU dependency, cannot reliably meet in the field. Unsupervized’s models deliver robust scene understanding, trajectory prediction, and sensor fusion directly on low-power hardware, enabling fully local, resilient autonomy for vehicles and aerial robots.  
* **Space Exploration:**  
  Satellites, planetary rovers, and deep-space probes must operate months or years without human intervention or high-bandwidth communications. Our energy-efficient, decentralized neural modules make it possible to perform adaptive mission planning, anomaly detection, and environmental modeling entirely onboard, at power budgets as low as a few watts. This marks a decisive improvement over transformer architectures, which require regular data uplinks and high-performance datacenter resources for meaningful adaptation.  
* **Deep Sea and Harsh Environments:**  
  In subsea robotics, underwater sensor networks, and remote monitoring, bandwidth is severely limited and hardware failure is routine. Unsupervized’s distributed, fault-tolerant neural agents can run on-site, supporting lifelong learning and decision-making with minimal compute and power, whereas transformer models are unviable without continuous cloud access or frequent maintenance.

By enabling real-time intelligence and adaptability on the edge, Unsupervized brings advanced AI to domains far beyond the reach of traditional, transformer-centric solutions, empowering new autonomy in robotics, mobility, exploration, and remote operations.

#### **Towards Sovereign AI**

Unsupervized sets a new standard for AI autonomy and control. By designing models that run efficiently on local hardware, from edge devices and on-premises servers to distributed fleets, we eliminate reliance on hyperscale cloud platforms and proprietary infrastructures. Organizations can now deploy, operate, and update advanced AI in their own environments, maintaining full ownership of both data and model behavior. This shift secures sensitive operations, reduces exposure to third-party outages or policy changes, and keeps mission-critical systems running even in disconnected or adversarial conditions. With Unsupervized, enterprises, governments, and research teams gain the technical independence to shape and safeguard their AI systems according to local needs and values, unlocking new possibilities for digital sovereignty in every sector.

#### **Conclusion**

Unsupervized Intelligence represents the next evolutionary leap in AI architectures, bridging cutting-edge neuroscience and AI engineering. Our biologically-inspired, energy-efficient, decentralized AI framework addresses the critical limitations of current Transformer-based architectures, positioning it as a foundational technology for future autonomous systems and sovereign AI deployments.
